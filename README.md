# p4h

(dysfunctional) Perforce Helix Core API wrapper

## Goal

This is the very implementation with my personal bias. It's far from mature.

- ✅ Run basic Perforce (p4) commands
- 🧪 Parse and format specs
- 🧪 Handle errors
- 🧪 Auxiliary functions
- ❓ Progress
- ❓ Revision & Integration
- ❓ Merge & Resolver
- ❓ Graph / Stream mode support

I don't quite like command line wrappers, so here it is. Probably not what you expected, as I know nothing about C++. I just make it compile, that's all.

If you have both Haskell and C++ expertise please help.

## Examples

An alternative version of [this](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4api/Content/P4API/clientapi.dropped.html#clientapi.dropped.example) example:

```haskell
example :: IO ()
example = withP4Env env $ \p4 -> do
  setProg p4 "unnamed haskell script"
  setVersion p4 "2023.06"
  setInput p4 "my-super-password"
  setHandler p4 (OutputInfo $ putStrLn . ("[Info] " ++))
  run p4 "login" >>= print
  let loop i = do
        isDropped <- dropped p4
        unless (isDropped || i > 9) $ do
          putStrLn $ "loop #" ++ show i
          run p4 "have" >>= print
          loop (i+1)
  loop 0
  where
    env = P4Env (Just "super") Nothing (Just "localhost") (Just "tcp:1666") (Just "my-workspace")
```

... would print something similiar to:

```
[Info] User super logged in.
User super logged in.
loop #0
[Info] //depot/test.txt#45 - /workspace/depot/test.txt
//depot/test.txt#45 - /workspace/depot/test.txt
... ...
```

In order to run `p4` commands, please use the following pattern:

```haskell
withP4Env env $ \p4 -> do
  ... -- other settings here
  setArgv p4 ["arg1", "arg2", ...]
  output <- run p4 "cmd"
  case output of
    Left err -> handle err
    Right ... -> ...
  ... -- do other stuff
  where
    env = P4Env client host password port user -- settings
```

### Spec parsing

```haskell
-- actual data omitted
parseSpec p4 typ form
```
...output examples:

```haskell
-- client
  Spec
    [ ("client", "Client"),
      ("update", "Update"),
      ("access", "Access"),
      ("owner", "Owner"),
      ("host", "Host"),
      ("description", "Description"),
      ("root", "Root"),
      ("altroots", "AltRoots"),
      ("options", "Options"),
      ("submitoptions", "SubmitOptions"),
      ("lineend", "LineEnd"),
      ("stream", "Stream"),
      ("streamatchange", "StreamAtChange"),
      ("serverid", "ServerID"),
      ("type", "Type"),
      ("backup", "Backup"),
      ("view", "View"),
      ("changeview", "ChangeView")
    ]
    [ ("View", Right ["//test/... //depot/test/..."]),
      ("LineEnd", Left "local"),
      ("SubmitOptions", Left "submitunchanged"),
      ("Options", Left "noallwrite noclobber nocompress unlocked nomodtime normdir"),
      ("Root", Left "/root/workspace"),
      ("Description", Left "       Created by superman.\n"),
      ("Host", Left "perforce"),
      ("Owner", Left "perforce"),
      ("Access", Left "2023/06/29 10:23:56"),
      ("Update", Left "2023/05/09 18:03:03"),
      ("Client", Left "test")
    ]
-- protect
  Spec
    [ ("subpath", "SubPath"),
      ("update", "Update"),
      ("protections", "Protections")
    ]
    [ ( "Protections",
        Right
          [ "write group a * //depot1/...",
            "write group b * //depot2/...",
            "list group c * -//depot3/...",
            "list group d * -//depot4/...",
            "list group e * -//depot5/...",
            "write group f * //depot6/...",
            "write group g * //depot7/...",
            "read group h * //depot8/...",
            "write group i * //depot9/...",
            "write group j * //depot10/...",
            "read group k * //depot11/...",
            "read group l * //depot12/...",
            "write group m * //depot/...",
            "super user n * //...",
            "super user o * //...",
            "super user p * //..."
          ]
      ),
      ("Update", Left "2023/06/19 10:25:38")
    ]
```

...however I'm still experimenting.

## Rationale

> The Helix Server protocol is not designed to support multiple concurrent queries over the same connection. Multithreaded applications that use the C++ API or derived APIs should ensure that a separate connection is used for each thread, or that only one thread may use a shared connection at a time.

That's what the document says, so I go create a new connection every time.

Use [Simple Haskell](https://www.simplehaskell.org/): avoid involving any advanced skills makes it easy to use. I know there's a Reader which could save some keystrokes, however I keep everything strictly in the IO monad.

I code C++ in C-style, I only make sure it compiles and won't leak serious memory.
Please also check [these](https://github.com/perforce/p4perl/) [official](https://github.com/perforce/p4python/) [repos](https://github.com/perforce/p4ruby).

## Build

Download the Helix Core C/C++ API [here](https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix-core-c/c-api).

Place up-to-date version of the header files into `p4api/include`. You also need to put the libs into the corresponding directory, check `extra-lib-dirs` in `package.yaml`.

### macOS

Don't forget to add the directory where `libssl` is located, you probably need to install OpenSSL via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

### Linux

API variants available:

- GLIBC 2.12 / 2.3
- OpenSSL 1.0.2 / 1.1.1 / 3

#### Debian

```
# apt install build-essential haskell-stack libssl-dev
```

#### CentOS

```
# yum install openssl-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
```
